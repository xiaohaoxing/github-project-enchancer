# Github Project Enhancement Tool


## Features:

### GitHub Project One-Click Fuzzy Search

GitHub's default search uses prefix matching, which is really counter-intuitive. This plugin adds a small format button on the page to enable one-click fuzzy search.

### Frequently Used Filters

- **Save Filters**: Click the ⭐ button to save current filter conditions with custom names
- **Quick Access**: Select saved filters from the dropdown menu above the search input
- **Delete Saved Filters**: Select "🗑️ 管理筛选条件" from the dropdown to view and delete saved filters

## Usage

1. Install the script in Tampermonkey
2. Navigate to any GitHub project page
3. Use the "模糊" button to convert searches to fuzzy format (title:*searchterm*)
4. Use the ⭐ button to save frequently used filter conditions
5. Access saved filters from the dropdown menu
